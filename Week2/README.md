## Bootcamp for Jesse - Week 2

Today we're going to be learning about GIT, running some python scripts, and going over anything and everything that wasn't clear during our last lesson. 

Outline of lesson:

1) Git => {GitHub, Stash, BitBucket, etc.}
2) Questions regarding Lesson 1
3) script1.py
4) script2.py
5) Find the year with the maximum number of injuries using mysql
6) Find the year with the maximum number of injuries getting all of the data into python, and having python find the maximum
7) Use numpy to fit a 5th dimensional polynomial to the data of injuries per year - not including insertions, and determine the expected number of injuries, given this fit, in 2017.
  * Hint: Check this out: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html
  * In particular, keep an eye out for `p = np.poly1d(z)` instead of having to write your own poly1d function!
